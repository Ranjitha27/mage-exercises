## Problem Statement
Write a function countWords() that takes a String input and returns a Map<String, Integer> object. The Map should contain words in the string as keys in alphabetical order and for each word the word count as value. The method should also remove any non-alphanumeric characters such as comma, fullstop etc. Also, the input should be converted into lowercase letters.


##Example

		Ramesh and Harish are good friends. Ramesh is a good student. Harish is an average student.
	Output:
		{a=1, an=1, and=1, are=1, average=1, friends=1, good=2, harish=2, is=2, ramesh=2, student=2}

	Input:
		123$32;45.234-123
	Output:
		{123=2, 234=1, 32=1, 45=1}

## Instructions
- Ensure your code compiles without any errors/warning/deprecations 
- Follow best practices while coding
- Avoid too many & unnecessary usage of white spaces (newline, spaces, tabs, ...), except to make the code readable
- Use appropriate comments at appropriate places in your exercise, to explain the logic, rational, solutions, so that evaluator can know them  
- Try to retain the original code given in the exercise, to avoid any issues in compiling & running your programs
- Always test the program thoroughly, before saving/submitting exercises/project
- For any issues with your exercise, contact your coach

## Warnings
- Take care of whitespace/trailing whitespace
- Trim the output and avoid special characters
- Avoid printing unnecessary values other than expected/asked output
