## Problem Statement
Write a function that accepts a number less than 100 and returns the fibonacci element at that position

Fibonacci elements are : 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, etc

###Validation rules:
- If the input is <=0 then the function should return -1
- If the input is >=100 then return -2

##Examples
	Input:
		7
	Output:
		8

	Input:
		10
	Output:
		34

	Input:
		-5
	Output:
		-1

## Instructions
- Ensure your code compiles without any errors/warning/deprecations 
- Follow best practices while coding
- Avoid too many & unnecessary usage of white spaces (newline, spaces, tabs, ...), except to make the code readable
- Use appropriate comments at appropriate places in your exercise, to explain the logic, rational, solutions, so that evaluator can know them  
- Try to retain the original code given in the exercise, to avoid any issues in compiling & running your programs
- Always test the program thoroughly, before saving/submitting exercises/project
- For any issues with your exercise, contact your coach


## Warnings
- Take care of whitespace/trailing whitespace
- Trim the output and avoid special characters
- Avoid printing unnecessary values other than expected/asked output
