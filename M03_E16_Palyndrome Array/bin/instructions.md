## Problem Statement
Write a function that takes an array of integers and check if the elements in the array forms a palyndrome or not. The function should return true if elements in the array are exactly same if the array is reversed (palyndrome). Return false otherwise.

##Examples:
	Input:
		[12, 33, 440, 5, 440, 33, 12]
	Output:
		true

	Input:
		[12, 23, 23, 12]
	Output:
		true

	Input:
		[12, 23, 12, 10]
	Output:
		false

## Instructions
- Ensure your code compiles without any errors/warning/deprecations 
- Follow best practices while coding
- Avoid too many & unnecessary usage of white spaces (newline, spaces, tabs, ...), except to make the code readable
- Use appropriate comments at appropriate places in your exercise, to explain the logic, rational, solutions, so that evaluator can know them  
- Try to retain the original code given in the exercise, to avoid any issues in compiling & running your programs
- Always test the program thoroughly, before saving/submitting exercises/project
- For any issues with your exercise, contact your coach


## Warnings
- Take care of whitespace/trailing whitespace
- Trim the output and avoid special characters
- Avoid printing unnecessary values other than expected/asked output
