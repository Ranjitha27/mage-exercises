## Problem Statement
Write a Java function to accept a number and return the reverse of the same. If the number ends with one or more zeros, then in the reversed number those zeros will not be present (since those zeros become leading zeros). 

If the input number is negative, the sign should be retained.

##Examples
	Input: 
		-123
	Output: 
		-321

	Input: 
		1123400
	Output: 
		43211

## Instructions
- Ensure your code compiles without any errors/warning/deprecations 
- Follow best practices while coding
- Avoid too many & unnecessary usage of white spaces (newline, spaces, tabs, ...), except to make the code readable
- Use appropriate comments at appropriate places in your exercise, to explain the logic, rational, solutions, so that evaluator can know them  
- Try to retain the original code given in the exercise, to avoid any issues in compiling & running your programs
- Always test the program thoroughly, before saving/submitting exercises/project
- For any issues with your exercise, contact your coach


## Warnings
- Take care of whitespace/trailing whitespace
- Trim the output and avoid special characters
- Avoid printing unnecessary values other than expected/asked output

## Hints/Tips
	Use 'while' loop
