## Problem Statement
A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. 
Write a function that accepts two integers as parametrers and return the sum of all the prime numbers between the input numbers. If the first parameter is greater than the second one, then swap the inputs and perform the operations.


## Example
	Input:
		10 50
	Output:
		311

	Input:
		50 -100
	Output:
		328

## Instructions
- Ensure your code compiles without any errors/warning/deprecations 
- Follow best practices while coding
- Avoid too many & unnecessary usage of white spaces (newline, spaces, tabs, ...), except to make the code readable
- Use appropriate comments at appropriate places in your exercise, to explain the logic, rational, solutions, so that evaluator can know them  
- Try to retain the original code given in the exercise, to avoid any issues in compiling & running your programs
- Always test the program thoroughly, before saving/submitting exercises/project
- For any issues with your exercise, contact your coach


## Warnings
- Take care of whitespace/trailing whitespace
- Trim the output and avoid special characters
- Avoid printing unnecessary values other than expected/asked output
