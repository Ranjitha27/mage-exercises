## Problem Statement
Write a function to accept an integer and return a number made up of digits from the input number in ascending order. 

If the input is a negative, then the change the order to descending.

## Example
	Input:
		48455
	Output:
		44558

	Input:
		15243
	Output:
		12345
		
	Input:
		-15243
	Output:
		-54321

## Instructions
- Ensure your code compiles without any errors/warning/deprecations 
- Follow best practices while coding
- Avoid too many & unnecessary usage of white spaces (newline, spaces, tabs, ...), except to make the code readable
- Use appropriate comments at appropriate places in your exercise, to explain the logic, rational, solutions, so that evaluator can know them  
- Try to retain the original code given in the exercise, to avoid any issues in compiling & running your programs
- Always test the program thoroughly, before saving/submitting exercises/project
- For any issues with your exercise, contact your coach


## Warnings
- Take care of whitespace/trailing whitespace
- Trim the output and avoid special characters
- Avoid printing unnecessary values other than expected/asked output

## Hints/Tips
	Write a function to get the smallest digit of a number and 
	another function to delete a digit from a number

	Call these functions repeatedly until there are no digits in the input
