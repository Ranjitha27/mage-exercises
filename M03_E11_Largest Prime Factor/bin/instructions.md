## Problem Statement
Write a function that accepts a number and return the largest prime factor of the same. For example, if the input is 13195, then the prime factors for the same are 5, 7, 13 and 29 hence the return value must be 29.

If the input is <=1, return -1
If the input itself is a prime, return -2

##Examples
	Input:
		16
	Output:
		2

	Input:
		90
	Output:
		5

## Instructions
- Ensure your code compiles without any errors/warning/deprecations 
- Follow best practices while coding
- Avoid too many & unnecessary usage of white spaces (newline, spaces, tabs, ...), except to make the code readable
- Use appropriate comments at appropriate places in your exercise, to explain the logic, rational, solutions, so that evaluator can know them  
- Try to retain the original code given in the exercise, to avoid any issues in compiling & running your programs
- Always test the program thoroughly, before saving/submitting exercises/project
- For any issues with your exercise, contact your coach


## Warnings
- Take care of whitespace/trailing whitespace
- Trim the output and avoid special characters
- Avoid printing unnecessary values other than expected/asked output
