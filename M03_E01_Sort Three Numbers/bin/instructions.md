## Problem Statement
Write a Java function with 3 int parameters a, b, and c to sort these inputs in ascending order by comparing and exchanging their values. At the end of the program a <= b <= c must hold.

You can solve this exercises with three 'if' in minimum. Test your method with all six permutation of three different numbers.

## Example

	Input: 
		100 40 300

	Output:
		40 100 300

## Instructions
- Ensure your code compiles without any errors/warning/deprecations 
- Follow best practices while coding
- Avoid too many & unnecessary usage of white spaces (newline, spaces, tabs, ...), except to make the code readable
- Use appropriate comments at appropriate places in your exercise, to explain the logic, rational, solutions, so that evaluator can know them  
- Try to retain the original code given in the exercise, to avoid any issues in compiling & running your programs
- Always test the program thoroughly, before saving/submitting exercises/project
- For any issues with your exercise, contact your coach


## Warnings
- Take care of whitespace/trailing whitespace
- Trim the output and avoid special characters
- Avoid printing unnecessary values other than expected/asked output
