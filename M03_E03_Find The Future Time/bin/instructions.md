## Problem Statement
Write a Java function to print the future time. The function takes 4 arguments. The first 3 arguments (h, m, s) represent a given time. The 4th argument is the number of seconds to add to the given time to find the future time. 

If the values for h, m, and s are not valid, an error message should be printed as "Invalid time input".

If the 4th argument is negative, it should be converted into it's absolute value.


## Example
	Input:	
		11 9 23 -200
	Output:
		11:12:43
		

## Instructions
- Ensure your code compiles without any errors/warning/deprecations 
- Follow best practices while coding
- Avoid too many & unnecessary usage of white spaces (newline, spaces, tabs, ...), except to make the code readable
- Use appropriate comments at appropriate places in your exercise, to explain the logic, rational, solutions, so that evaluator can know them  
- Try to retain the original code given in the exercise, to avoid any issues in compiling & running your programs
- Always test the program thoroughly, before saving/submitting exercises/project
- For any issues with your exercise, contact your coach


## Warnings
- Take care of whitespace/trailing whitespace
- Trim the output and avoid special characters
- Avoid printing unnecessary values other than expected/asked output
