## Problem Statement
Write a Java function to accept a number containing only 0s and 1s and treating the input as a binary number, return the decimal equivalent of the same.

If the input is not a binary number, then return -1

##Example
	Input: 
		100001
	Output: 
		65

	Input: 
		1000100000100
	Output: 
		4356

## Instructions
- Ensure your code compiles without any errors/warning/deprecations 
- Follow best practices while coding
- Avoid too many & unnecessary usage of white spaces (newline, spaces, tabs, ...), except to make the code readable
- Use appropriate comments at appropriate places in your exercise, to explain the logic, rational, solutions, so that evaluator can know them  
- Try to retain the original code given in the exercise, to avoid any issues in compiling & running your programs
- Always test the program thoroughly, before saving/submitting exercises/project
- For any issues with your exercise, contact your coach

## Warnings
- Take care of whitespace/trailing whitespace
- Trim the output and avoid special characters
- Avoid printing unnecessary values other than expected/asked output

## Hints/Tips
	Use Math.pow, if required.
