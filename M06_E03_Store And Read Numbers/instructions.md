##Problem statement
Store And Read Numbers

Write a function called "store" that takes an array of objects as parameters and writes the content into a binary file. The first argument should be a string representing the filename. The rest of the elements of the array can be of any type. However, the function should only write Double objects. If the first argument is not a String, then the filename should assumed to be "numbers.dat".

Write another function called "read" to read the content of the file. The filename is supplied as an argument and it should return an array of Double objects.

##Example:

	If you are testing the code using command line inputs, then supply the inputs excluding the filename in the following sequence:

		29 pqrs 49.56 asdf 100 29.3

	The output for the above input would print the following:

		[29.0, 49.56, 100.0, 29.3]


## Instructions
- Ensure your code compiles without any errors/warning/deprecations 
- Follow best practices while coding
- Avoid too many & unnecessary usage of white spaces (newline, spaces, tabs, ...), except to make the code readable
- Use appropriate comments at appropriate places in your exercise, to explain the logic, rational, solutions, so that evaluator can know them  
- Try to retain the original code given in the exercise, to avoid any issues in compiling & running your programs
- Always test the program thoroughly, before saving/submitting exercises/project
- For any issues with your exercise, contact your coach

		
## Warnings
- Take care of whitespace/trailing whitespace
- Trim the output and avoid special characters
- Avoid printing unnecessary values other than expected/asked output
