## Problem Statement
Write a function that takes an array as input and returns an array of 2 numbers. The returned array contains the sum of even numbers and sum of odd numbers from the input.

If any of the input is null it should be treated as an empty array

##Example:
	Input:
		[30, 18, 2, 83, 20, 71]
	Output:
		[70, 154]
		

	Input:
		[14, 11, 10, 67, 41]
	Output:
		[24, 119]
		

	Input:
		[36, 24, -82, 29, 44, -3, -100, -5, 49]
	Output:
		[-78, 70]
		

## Instructions
- Ensure your code compiles without any errors/warning/deprecations 
- Follow best practices while coding
- Avoid too many & unnecessary usage of white spaces (newline, spaces, tabs, ...), except to make the code readable
- Use appropriate comments at appropriate places in your exercise, to explain the logic, rational, solutions, so that evaluator can know them  
- Try to retain the original code given in the exercise, to avoid any issues in compiling & running your programs
- Always test the program thoroughly, before saving/submitting exercises/project
- For any issues with your exercise, contact your coach


## Warnings
- Take care of whitespace/trailing whitespace
- Trim the output and avoid special characters
- Avoid printing unnecessary values other than expected/asked output
