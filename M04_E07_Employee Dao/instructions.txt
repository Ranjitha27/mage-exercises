## Problem Statement
Create a class called "Employee" with the following fields:
- id: int
- name: String
- salary: double

Create an interface "EmployeeDao" with the following methods:
- addEmployee(employee: Employee): boolean
- getEmployee(id: int): Employee
- updateEmployee(id: int, employee: Employee): boolean
- deleteEmployee(id: int): boolean

Create an implementation for the above interface using HashMap. Name the class as "HashMapEmployeeDao". The overridden methods should provide appropriate functionalities as suggested by the names of the methods.

## Instructions
- Ensure your code compiles without any errors/warning/deprecations 
- Follow best practices while coding
- Avoid too many & unnecessary usage of white spaces (newline, spaces, tabs, ...), except to make the code readable
- Use appropriate comments at appropriate places in your exercise, to explain the logic, rational, solutions, so that evaluator can know them  
- Try to retain the original code given in the exercise, to avoid any issues in compiling & running your programs
- Always test the program thoroughly, before saving/submitting exercises/project
- For any issues with your exercise, contact your coach


## Warnings
- Take care of whitespace/trailing whitespace
- Trim the output and avoid special characters
- Avoid printing unnecessary values other than expected/asked output
