## Problem Statement
Write a function that takes two integer arrays as arguments and return an array consisting of odd numbers from both arrays. 

If any of the inputs are null it should be treated as an empty array

##Example
	Input:
		[10, 30, 49, 55, 56] and [12, 44, 27], 
	Output:
		[49, 55, 27]

## Instructions
- Ensure your code compiles without any errors/warning/deprecations 
- Follow best practices while coding
- Avoid too many & unnecessary usage of white spaces (newline, spaces, tabs, ...), except to make the code readable
- Use appropriate comments at appropriate places in your exercise, to explain the logic, rational, solutions, so that evaluator can know them  
- Try to retain the original code given in the exercise, to avoid any issues in compiling & running your programs
- Always test the program thoroughly, before saving/submitting exercises/project
- For any issues with your exercise, contact your coach


## Warnings
- Take care of whitespace/trailing whitespace
- Trim the output and avoid special characters
- Avoid printing unnecessary values other than expected/asked output
