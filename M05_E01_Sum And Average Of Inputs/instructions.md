## Problem Statement

Write a program that reads from command line arguments and prints the result. The first argument should be an int representing the number of inputs to process. For example, if args[0] is 5 then the total number of command line arguments should be 6. The program should read the number of arguments specified by the first argument and calculate the sum & average of all numbers in the inputs. Following should be taken care of in the program:

1. If no command line arguments were supplied, print "NO INPUT"
2. If the first argument is not an int, print "FIRST ARGUMENT SHOULD BE INT"
3. If the first argument is less than 1, print "FIRST ARGUMENT SHOULD BE >0"
4. If the first argument is "n" and the total number of arguments is not "n+1", then print "INSUFFICIENT INPUTS"
5. If sufficient inputs are given in the specified format, then the result should be as follows:
THE SUM IS 99
THE AVERAGE IS 99
NUMERICAL INPUTS 99
NON NUMERICAL INPUTS 99

For example, 
	if the inputs are:
		3 8 asd 9
	the output should be:
		THE SUM IS 12.0
		THE AVERAGE IS 6.0
		NUMERICAL INPUTS 2
		NON NUMERICAL INPUTS 1

## Instructions
- Ensure your code compiles without any errors/warning/deprecations 
- Follow best practices while coding
- Avoid too many & unnecessary usage of white spaces (newline, spaces, tabs, ...), except to make the code readable
- Use appropriate comments at appropriate places in your exercise, to explain the logic, rational, solutions, so that evaluator can know them  
- Try to retain the original code given in the exercise, to avoid any issues in compiling & running your programs
- Always test the program thoroughly, before saving/submitting exercises/project
- For any issues with your exercise, contact your coach


## Warnings
- Take care of whitespace/trailing whitespace
- Trim the output and avoid special characters
- Avoid printing unnecessary values other than expected/asked output
