## Problem Statement
Write a function that accepts a number as parameter and returns the nearest integer square root for the same. For example, if the input is 30, then the return value is 5, since square of 5 is 25 and square of 6 is 36. Similarly if the input is 125, then the return value must be 11 (since 11x11=121 and 12x12=144).

If the input is not a positive number, return -1.
If there are no square roots near the input number, then return -2

##Examples
	Input:
		55
	Output:
		7

	Input:
		-1234
	Output:
		-1

## Instructions
- Ensure your code compiles without any errors/warning/deprecations 
- Follow best practices while coding
- Avoid too many & unnecessary usage of white spaces (newline, spaces, tabs, ...), except to make the code readable
- Use appropriate comments at appropriate places in your exercise, to explain the logic, rational, solutions, so that evaluator can know them  
- Try to retain the original code given in the exercise, to avoid any issues in compiling & running your programs
- Always test the program thoroughly, before saving/submitting exercises/project
- For any issues with your exercise, contact your coach


## Warnings
- Take care of whitespace/trailing whitespace
- Trim the output and avoid special characters
- Avoid printing unnecessary values other than expected/asked output

##Hints / tips
- Use while loop
