## Problem Statement
Create a class called StringStack that has a private member array of Strings. The class should provide the following members:

- default constructor (initializes the array to 5 Strings)
- overloaded constructor to recieve the non-negative size of the array and initialize the array to the specified size. If a negative number is passed, its absolute value should be considered.
- boolean push(String str) to push a non-null and non-empty string into the stack. If there stack is full, return false.
- String pop() to pop the last element pushed. If there are no elements, returns null
