## Problem Statement
Write a function that accepts a filename as parameter and returns a double value. The function should read the input file and should calculate the sum of all the numerical data in the file. The file may contain alpha-numerical data with any special characters too. If a number is attached to one or more alphabets, only its numerical value should taken into consideration. For example, the phrases abc123, 123abc, or abc123def should be treated as 123. Also, abc123.4 or 123.4abc or abc123.4abc should be considered as 123.4

If a number has more than dots, then it should not be considered as a valid number and should be ignored.

## Instructions
- Ensure your code compiles without any errors/warning/deprecations 
- Follow best practices while coding
- Avoid too many & unnecessary usage of white spaces (newline, spaces, tabs, ...), except to make the code readable
- Use appropriate comments at appropriate places in your exercise, to explain the logic, rational, solutions, so that evaluator can know them  
- Try to retain the original code given in the exercise, to avoid any issues in compiling & running your programs
- Always test the program thoroughly, before saving/submitting exercises/project
- For any issues with your exercise, contact your coach


## Warnings
- Take care of whitespace/trailing whitespace
- Trim the output and avoid special characters
- Avoid printing unnecessary values other than expected/asked output

## Hints/Tips
    Use file and exception handling
