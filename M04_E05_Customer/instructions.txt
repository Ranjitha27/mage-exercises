## Problem Statement
Create a class called "Customer" with the following fields:
- id: int
- name: String
- birthDate: java.util.Date
- city: String

Provide default and overloaded constructors along with the getters and setters for all the fields.
The parameter "birthDate" in the overloaded constructor and the setter for the "birthDate" field should accept String.

Override the "hashCode()" method to return a number based on the values of id, name, birthDate and city.

Calling hashCode methods on two different objects with the similar data should result in the same value.


## Instructions
- Ensure your code compiles without any errors/warning/deprecations 
- Follow best practices while coding
- Avoid too many & unnecessary usage of white spaces (newline, spaces, tabs, ...), except to make the code readable
- Use appropriate comments at appropriate places in your exercise, to explain the logic, rational, solutions, so that evaluator can know them  
- Try to retain the original code given in the exercise, to avoid any issues in compiling & running your programs
- Always test the program thoroughly, before saving/submitting exercises/project
- For any issues with your exercise, contact your coach


## Warnings
- Take care of whitespace/trailing whitespace
- Trim the output and avoid special characters
- Avoid printing unnecessary values other than expected/asked output
