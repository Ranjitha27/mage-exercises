## Problem Statement
Write a Java program that takes a command line input and attempts to find its data type. The input may be a boolean, int, double or String.
The program should print the datatype along with the input value.

## Example
	Input: 
		vinod
	Output:
		String vinod
		
	Input:
		300
	Output:
		int 300

## Instructions
- Ensure your code compiles without any errors/warning/deprecations 
- Follow best practices while coding
- Avoid too many & unnecessary usage of white spaces (newline, spaces, tabs, ...), except to make the code readable
- Use appropriate comments at appropriate places in your exercise, to explain the logic, rational, solutions, so that evaluator can know them  
- Try to retain the original code given in the exercise, to avoid any issues in compiling & running your programs
- Always test the program thoroughly, before saving/submitting exercises/project
- For any issues with your exercise, contact your coach


## Warnings
- Take care of whitespace/trailing whitespace
- Trim the output and avoid special characters
- Avoid printing unnecessary values other than expected/asked output

## Hints/Tips
	Use nested try-catch blocks.
