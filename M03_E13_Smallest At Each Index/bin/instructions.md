## Problem Statement
Write a function that takes two arrays of integers, and return an array consisting of numbers from both the arrays such that value at a given index i of the returned array is equal to the smallest of the two values at index i of the input arrays.

For example, if A1 and A2 are input arrays and A3 is the returned array, then value of A3 at index i is equals to the smallest among A1[i] and A2[i].

The length of the returned array is equals to the length of the largest array. For all the exces elements in the largest array, the values are simply copied to the returned array.

If any of the inputs are null it should be treated as an empty array

##Example:
	Input:
		"9, 69, 40, 31, 18, 69" "5, 75, 18, 18, 14, 82"
	Output:
		[5, 69, 18, 18, 14, 69]

## Instructions
- Ensure your code compiles without any errors/warning/deprecations 
- Follow best practices while coding
- Avoid too many & unnecessary usage of white spaces (newline, spaces, tabs, ...), except to make the code readable
- Use appropriate comments at appropriate places in your exercise, to explain the logic, rational, solutions, so that evaluator can know them  
- Try to retain the original code given in the exercise, to avoid any issues in compiling & running your programs
- Always test the program thoroughly, before saving/submitting exercises/project
- For any issues with your exercise, contact your coach


## Warnings
- Take care of whitespace/trailing whitespace
- Trim the output and avoid special characters
- Avoid printing unnecessary values other than expected/asked output
