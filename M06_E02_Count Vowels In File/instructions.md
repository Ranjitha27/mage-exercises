## Problem Statement
Count Vowels In File

Write a Java program that accepts a filename as command line argument. The program should read the number of vowels and print the same. 

For example,

    if the input file is a valid filename, "file1.txt", then the program should print the number of vowels in it (which is 179 in this case). If the user does not supply any command line arguments, then an error message "Exactly one argument expected" should be printed. If the input file does not exist, then an error message "Input file does not exist" should be printed.
	

## Instructions
- Ensure your code compiles without any errors/warning/deprecations 
- Follow best practices while coding
- Avoid too many & unnecessary usage of white spaces (newline, spaces, tabs, ...), except to make the code readable
- Use appropriate comments at appropriate places in your exercise, to explain the logic, rational, solutions, so that evaluator can know them  
- Try to retain the original code given in the exercise, to avoid any issues in compiling & running your programs
- Always test the program thoroughly, before saving/submitting exercises/project
- For any issues with your exercise, contact your coach

## Warnings
- Take care of whitespace/trailing whitespace
- Trim the output and avoid special characters
- Avoid printing unnecessary values other than expected/asked output
